# Changelog

All notable public changes should be recorded here.

The format follows Keep a Changelog principles and uses semantic versioning for
public releases.

## Unreleased

- No unreleased public changes.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-16

- Added the operator-first CLI path: `factoryctl doctor`, `factoryctl init` and
  `factoryctl run minimal`.
- Added public docs site navigation, CLI reference, Hermes install guide,
  example gallery, release policy and OSS security guide.
- Added Dependabot, CodeQL, Dependency Review and security workflow surfaces.
- Replaced dead public metadata URLs with canonical GitHub metadata, added a
  `.github/` entrypoint README and tightened public-safety scanning around
  metadata-only repository URLs and generated local build output.
- Added factory-owned recovery, status, readiness, truth and blocker paths so
  non-human blocks route back into explicit repair actions instead of hidden
  operator work.
- Added Product Face proof profiles, executable state/journey drivers and
  stricter Product Face PASS validation.
- Added capability-pack activation, full-product worker graph contracts and
  production/release preflight checks for public-safe repository releases.
- Added public-surface synchronization checks so docs and the published visual
  map can be verified against the repository source of truth.

Known boundary: the public repository release validates the factory kernel,
schemas, docs, CLI, examples and public safety. Private runtime/operator console
production readiness still requires operator-owned Hermes evidence and real
approval records outside the public repo.

## 0.1.0

- Initial public alpha package metadata, public quickstart, Hermes adapter,
  worker registry, schemas, examples and validation scripts.
